Assignment 1
============

This project is a collection of programs that take in user data and output to ultimately build simplistic and introductory stack machines in C.

Program 1
---------

This program takes input from the user (no more than 65 characters) and prints out the input space-delimited and surrounded by equals signs.

Program 2
---------

This program takes input from the user (no more than 65 characters) by displaying a ">". The output will display whether each token input (space delimited) was a string or an int.


Program 3
---------

This program takes input from the user (no more than 65 characters) by displaying a ">". There may only be two tokens inputted, otherwise there will be an error message printed. The two tokens will display if they were strings or ints.

Program 4
---------

This program takes input from the user (no more than 20 characters) by displaying a ">". If there is more than 20 cahracters there will be an error and if there are more than two tokens there will be an error. If there are no errors, the result will print whether each token was a string or an int.

Program 5
---------

This program takes input from the user (no more than 65 characters) by displaing a ">". It has all of the same errors as Program 4, except it only prints out STR and INT iff it is in the order of STR INT or STR. The program exits on "quit"

Program 6
---------

This program behaves exactly as Program 5 does, except it initially takes only one argument on the run command to determine how many commands the program will run on. The program terminates after the user set number of commands or "quit".
